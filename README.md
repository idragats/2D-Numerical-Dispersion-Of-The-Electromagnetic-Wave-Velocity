# 2D Numerical Dispersion Of The Electromagnetic Wave Velocity
## Computational Electromagnetics
In this section we write a matlab code to study the 2Dimensional numerical dispersion of the electromagnetic wave velocity. 
We detected the differences between uniform and non-uniform grid. 
In the uniform grid, we used three different grid steps (λ/5, λ/10, λ/20). 
On the other hand, for the non-uniform grid we used two differend grid steps (λ/5, λ/10)
